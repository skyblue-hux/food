<div id="whole_thing">

  <div id="instruct">
    <h2><u>Instructions</u></h2>
      <ol>
        <li class="way">Cut steak into 1" to 1 1/2" squares.</li>
        <li class="way">Trim away and discard the white tough core and sinews from the kidneys and cut into 1/2" cubes.</li>
        <li class="way">Coat the steak and kidney separately with seasoned flour. Toss well to blend. Shake off excess.</li>
        <li class="way">Cut the mushrooms into quarters or slices or leave whole, depending on size.</li>
        <li class="way">Heat the butter or oil in a heavy skillet and lightly brown the steak.</li>
        <li class="way">Put on only a few pieces at a time to insure they are sealed on all sides.</li>
        <li class="way">Remove, then brown the kidney. Place steak and kidney in warm dish.</li>
        <li class="way">Saute the onion until wilted. Add mushrooms and garlic until mushrooms start to brown.</li>
        <li class="way">Remove to a 4 or 5 quart cooking pot over low medium heat and add tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce and thyme.</li>
        <li class="way">Slowly add sufficient stock, stirring all the time, until it becomes a gravy. Add seasoned flour if needed. Bring to a boil and cook about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li class="way">Place steak and kidney in the cooking pot and add additional stock so that the meat is almost covered.</li>
        <li class="way">Cover with lid, place in 300 degree oven and bake about 1 1/2 hours or until steak is thoroughly tender. (If the liquid level drops, add more beef stock. Cool and refrigerate overnight.)</li>
        <li class="way">Spoon meat and sauce into an 8-cup baking pan.</li>
        <li class="way">The pie should have plenty of gravy and not become dry. Brush around outside edge of baking dish with beaten egg.</li>
        <li class="way">Cover with pie crust. Decorate with pastry cut outs. Cut hole 1" or smaller in the center of the pastry and a few slashes to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li class="way">Brush with a little beaten egg. Set dish on a flat pan and place in oven.</li>
        <li class="way">Bake at 425 degrees for 40 minutes for a large single dish or 32 minutes for small individual oval dishes.</li>
        <li class="way"><h3>For the pie pastry:<h3/></li>
        <li class="way">2 cups flour, 2/3 cup Crisco, salt to taste and 4 to 5 tablespoons ice water. Put flour and salt in mixing bowl.</li>
        <li class="way">Add Crisco and cut it in with 2 knives or pastry blender until mixture looks like coarse cornmeal.</li>
        <li class="way">Using fork, start tossing mixture while adding water. Add just enough water until dough holds together.</li>
        <li class="way">Shape dough into ball. Wrap in waxed paper and chill overnight or for at least 12 hours. Roll as needed.</li>
      </ol>
